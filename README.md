# Request-Reply-Messaging-App
The purpose of this assignment is to become familiar with network programming. Within this work a distributed message exchange system will be developed that uses a simple request-response protocol. Customers send to Server a Request and then the Server responds with a Response and their connection terminates. The technologies you are asked to use are either of these Sockets (Sockets-I/O streams-Threads), or RMI (Remote Method Invocation).
In this system different users will be able to create accounts and send messages to each other, as the server will manage them. This functionality will be provided to them by:
a) a server program, which will have the ability to manage simultaneously multiple requests from clients, and
b) client programs, each of which will have the ability to send requests to the server.
